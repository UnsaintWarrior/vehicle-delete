# vehicle-delete
 Its my first scrip in LUA, made to work with FiveM. It simply deletes the vehicle the player is or last was in.

# Install
In order to install this script in your server follow the steps bellow:

    1 - Download the code from GitHub.
    2 - Extract the folder in to your \resorces folder of you server 
    3 - ensure/start it in your 'server.cfg' file
        3.1 - ensure/start will depend on what 'server.cfg' file you are    using. I recomend you use watever is already being used inthe file.
